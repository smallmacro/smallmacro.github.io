## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

- customize a layout for tablet(640px~900px)
- Load the json data file into UI

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- basic ES6 



### What I learned
1. Safely munipulate the DOM by listening to the `DOMContenLoaded` event.

2. Complete the basic ES6 syntax learning and use the `let` and  `arrow function`

3. Load the json data through `fetch` function.

4. Mobile-first flow works well since there are many similarities among the mobile, tablet(customized by myself) and desktop design.

### Continued development
If considered the performance of the loading page, is there something needed to be improved?

### Useful resources
