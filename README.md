## Overview

### The challenge
My final goal is to tackle at least the `advanced` level project.


### Project Links

- [Challenge1: Order summary component](https://smallmacro.github.io/challenge1/)

- [Challenge2: Four Card Feature Section](https://smallmacro.github.io/challenge2/)


## My process
- `Newbie` projects purely with `html` and `css` completed.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties(Css Variables)
- Google Fonts
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
-  11.3. The strategy on mobile-first or desktop=first depends on the similarities between the PC design and mobile. And the implementation of it in `challenge2` project really works well.



### Continued development
-  `Junior` challenges 


### Useful resources

- [The State Of Mobile First and Desktop First](https://ishadeed.com/article/the-state-of-mobile-first-and-desktop-first/) - This article helps me figure out  how to make decision between the Moble-first and PC first workflow.
