## Overview

### The challenge
My final goal is to tackle at least the `advanced` level project.


### Project Links

- [Challenge1: Order summary component](https://smallmacro.github.io/challenge1/)

- [Challenge2: Four Card Feature Section](https://smallmacro.github.io/challenge2/)

- [Challenge3: Time tracking dashboard challenge](https://smallmacro.github.io/challenge3/)


## My process
- `Newbie` projects purely with `html` and `css` completed.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties(CSS Variables)
- Google Fonts
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
-  11.3. The strategy on mobile-first or desktop=first depends on the similarities between the PC design and mobile. And the implementation of it in `challenge2` project really works well.

- 11.8 
  1. Safely munipulate the DOM by listening to the `DOMContenLoaded` event.

  2. Complete the basic ES6 syntax learning and use the `let` and  `arrow function`

  3. Load the json data through `fetch` function.

  4. Mobile-first flow works well since there are many similarities among the mobile, tablet(customized by myself) and desktop design.


### Continued development
-  `Junior` challenges 


### Useful resources

- [The State Of Mobile First and Desktop First](https://ishadeed.com/article/the-state-of-mobile-first-and-desktop-first/) - This article helps me figure out  how to make decision between the Moble-first and PC first workflow.

- [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) - Great and simple screen recording app, really recommand it.
