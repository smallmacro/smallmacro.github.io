## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties(Css Variables)
- Google Fonts
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this simple webpage, I used Mobile-first workflow and it seems to work well.



### Continued development

This page is so simple, maybe it needs some interactive effect.
The box-shadow used in these grid cards seems a little different from design. It can be solved by accessing the original sketch or figma files.

### Useful resources

- [The State Of Mobile First and Desktop First](https://ishadeed.com/article/the-state-of-mobile-first-and-desktop-first/) - This article helps me figure out  how to make decision between the Moble-first and PC first workflow.
